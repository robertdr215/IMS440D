Can use Node.js and Notepad++ to run locally for coding/testing - or whatever you're most comfortable with if you have other software you prefer. This link explains how to do Node.js about 1/3 down the page if you haven't used that before (https://gist.github.com/jgravois/5e73b56fa7756fd00b89). Please push any updates once you're done with them so we're all working on the same version of the code. Thanks!   - Dalton
